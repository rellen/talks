* The Erlang ecosystem


* Elixir

** Brief history of Elixir

- created by José Valim starting in 2012
- in search of a safer, faster, and more scalable Ruby
- inspired by Erlang, Ruby, and, to a lesser extent, Lisp
- José got the idea to use Erlang from Bruce Tate's /Seven Languages in Seven Weeks/

** Features of Elixir

- Ruby-like syntax while retaining most of Erlang's semantics
- interoperate with Erlang
- highly ergonomic build tool: ~mix~
- modern package manager: ~hex~
- opinionated formatter
- drops SSA


** Pipelines (|>)

** with form
