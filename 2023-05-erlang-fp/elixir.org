* Typed Functional Programming Now

[[file:now.png]]

** Types and Elixir

- Elixir is dynamically-typed - who knew?
- but a static type system is a much-missed feature for many FP enthusiasts
- Elixir inherits the =@spec= type spec syntax
  + several static analysis tools make use of this
- recently, work has begun on a static type system for Elixir

** Agenda

- Static analysis tools
  + Dialyzer
  + Gradient
- Type-adjacent libraries
  + Typeclasses and Algebraic data-types with Witchcraft and Algae
- sneak-peak at the new Set-Theoretic static type system for Elixir
