** The BEAM

- Erlang's virtual machine / runtime system
- lightweight processes, SMP
- multi-generational, per-process garbage collector
- asynchronous, location-transparent, message-passing IPC
- hot-code-loading
- new JIT compiler (BEAM bytecode to machine code)


** The OTP libraries

- Erlang's "standard library"
- dozens of modules providing various typical stdlib stuff
- core of which are for supervision trees

** =gen_server=

- generic server process
- implements a behaviour with callbacks:
  + initialisation
  + handling calls (known synchronous messages)
  + handling casts (known asynchronous messages)
  + handling out-of-band messages (e.g. timers)
  + graceful termination
  + hot-code-loading

** supervisor

- responsible for starting, stopping, and monitoring child processes
- /child specifications/ dictate how child processes are restarted if they crash, whether other processes are affected by a crash, and if the supervisor itself should shut down
