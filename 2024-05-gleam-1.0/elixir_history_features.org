** Elixir

** Brief history of Elixir

- created by Jos√© Valim starting in 2012
- inspired by Erlang, Ruby, and, to a lesser extent, Lisp
- like Erlang, the language is quite stable

** Features of Elixir

- Ruby-like syntax while retaining most of Erlang's semantics
  + ..., immutable data, HoF, side-effects anywhere, dynamically-typed, ...
- interoperate with Erlang
- hygienic macros
- highly ergonomic build tool: ~mix~
- modern package manager: ~hex~
- excellent unit test tool: exunit
- opinionated formatter
- drops strict SSA in favour of rebinding
