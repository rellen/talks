** Summary

- Q: ..., A: ``A static type system!"
- rich history of static type systems for BEAM languages
- R&D project to build the definitive static type system for Elixir
- gradual semantic subtyping with innovations for Elixir's features
- gradual introduction into production Elixir compiler

** Disclaimer

- I am not a student of programming language / type theory
- mistakes are my own
- check out the paper and references

** Demo time!

** Conclusion

- Static Type Systems Now! (or soon)
- innovations on semantic subtyping / set-theoretic type
- incremental release--stick with dialyzer for now and hope for a migration tool

** Thank you

I'll post slides somewhere (luma/discord/?) soon.

For my other talks as well...
