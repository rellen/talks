* The BEAM and OTP

** The BEAM

- Erlang's virtual machine / runtime system
- lightweight processes, SMP, low-latency IO, soft realtime, minimal locks
- multi-generational, per-process garbage collector
- asynchronous, location-transparent, message passing IPC
- hot-code-loading
- powerful REPL and introspection tools
- new JIT compiler (BEAM bytecode to machine code)


** The OTP libraries

- Erlang's ``standard library"
- dozens of modules providing various typical stdlib stuff
- core of which are for supervision trees
  + =gen_server= - actors / workers
  + supervisors - handling starting/stopping/restarting =gen_servers=
