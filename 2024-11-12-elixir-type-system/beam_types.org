** Static analysis tools

 - rely on the Erlang Typespec notation - not checked by compiler
 - dialyzer - success-typing - Linhahl & Sagonas, 2006
 - gradualizer - gradual set-theoretic-inspired typing

** Typed BEAM languages with alternate semantics

 - Hamler - PureScript for the BEAM
 - Caramel - ML for the BEAM
 - Gleam - Rust/Ocaml/Elm inspired - HM type system
